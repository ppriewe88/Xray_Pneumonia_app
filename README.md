Main functionalities:
  - Training (backend):
    - model training: own CNN model, transfer learning (MobileNet), fine tuning (MobileNet)
    - tracking of training perfomance with `mlflow`
  - Model administration & tracking (backend):
    - model registration with `mlflow`
    - csv logging of model performance on new, unseen data
    - supervision of and automated switch between two competing models ("champion" vs "challenger")
  - Frontend:
    - image upload and inferrence (pneumonia indication)
    - visualization of ML models' performance
    - embedded API documentation and model administration panel

</p>

Locally prepare Git:
   - Initialize empty git repository in a local folder (git init)
   - Specify this Github repository here as the remote origin
   - Pull content of this repo to your local one (git pull origin main)

Build docker image from local repo (project directory), by running the following command from project directory:
   - docker build -f virtualization/Dockerfile.fullstack -t xray_pneumonia .


Then build and run docker container, by running the following command from project directory:
   - docker run -d --name xray_container -p 8000:8000 -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 xray_pneumonia
