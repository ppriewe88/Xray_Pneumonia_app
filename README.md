temporary hint:
if keras files are fraudulent due to size and lfs handling, copy original keras-objects from origin main, and add replace locally in mlartifacts folder. Then run the following command for each mlartifacts run:

git update-index --skip-worktree unified_experiment/mlartifacts/168696106470894349/d5862d0d02ae42f6a5e02dd18b4c842d/artifacts/model_artifact/data/model.keras
